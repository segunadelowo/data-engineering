# Data-engineering
This repository contains projects done during my Udacity nano degree course.

## Projects
### Data Modeling with PostgreSQL
Built a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. I tested the database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to me by the analytics team from Sparkify and compared my results with their expected results.

### Data Warehouse with AWS Redshift
Built an AWS Redshift database with tables designed to optimize queries.
 
### Data Lake with Spark
Created ETL pipelines that extracts data from AWS S3, processes the data using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables.

### Data Pipelines with Airflow
Built ETL pipelines using Airflow.
